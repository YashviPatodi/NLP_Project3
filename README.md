# "Exploratory Data Analysis and Probability Distributions"

This project conducts a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizes probability distributions using the Titanic dataset to uncover trends and statistical properties.

Key Focus Areas:

    1.Data Exploration: In-depth dataset examination to assess structure and data types.
    2.Statistical Analysis: Calculating summary statistics and identifying outliers.
    3.Probability Distributions: Visualization of distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, etc.)
      to analyze probabilities and data spread.

Core Tasks:

    -Data Cleaning: Removing null values and adjusting data types for consistency.
    -Statistical Summary: Calculating metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
    -Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling extreme values.
    -Distribution Visualization: Plotting major probability distributions for enhanced data insight.
